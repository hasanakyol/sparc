### Hierarchical Resource Management

#### Door Hierarchy
The door access control system follows a strict hierarchical structure:
**Tenant > Organization > Site > Building > Floor > Zone > Door**

Each door is assigned to a specific zone, allowing for:
- Zone-based access policies
- Emergency lockdown by zone
- Zone-specific schedules and permissions
- Grouped reporting and analytics

#### Camera Hierarchy
The camera surveillance system follows the same hierarchical structure:
**Tenant > Organization > Site > Building > Floor > Zone > Camera**

Each camera includes:
- `zone_id`: Assignment to a specific zone for logical grouping
- Zone-based video retention policies
- Zone-specific privacy settings
- Coordinated alerts with door access events in the same zone
- Grouped camera views by zone

This unified hierarchy ensures:
- Consistent management across access control and video surveillance
- Simplified permission inheritance
- Efficient resource organization
- Scalable policy application

### Tenant Isolation Features
- **Database Level**: Tenant-specific schemas with row-level security
- **Application Level**: Tenant context in all service calls
- **API Level**: Tenant-scoped authentication tokens
- **Storage Level**: Tenant-specific object storage buckets
- **Resource Level**: Per-tenant quotas and usage tracking
- **Branding Level**: Tenant-specific UI customization

### Deployment Model Support
- **SSP-Managed**: Multi-client organization management with complete isolation
- **Self-Managed**: Direct enterprise control without SSP layer overhead
- **Hybrid**: Shared access with time-based responsibility handoffs
- **Model Transitions**: Seamless switching between deployment approaches
- **Context Switching**: <2 second performance for SSP client switching

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Local Development Issues

**Issue**: Services fail to start
```bash
# Solution: Check Docker services
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs

# Restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**Issue**: Database connection errors
```bash
# Solution: Verify PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose logs postgres

# Reset database
npm run db:reset
npm run migrate
```

**Issue**: Port conflicts
```bash
# Solution: Check for conflicting processes
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend port
lsof -i :8000  # API Gateway port

# Kill conflicting processes or change ports in .env
```

#### Production Deployment Issues

**Issue**: CDK deployment fails
```bash
# Solution: Verify AWS credentials and permissions
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam get-user

# Check CDK bootstrap
cdk bootstrap
```

**Issue**: Service health check failures
```bash
# Solution: Run health check script
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh production --health-check-only

# Check individual service logs
kubectl logs -n sparc deployment/access-control-service
```

**Issue**: Database migration errors
```bash
# Solution: Check migration status
npm run migrate:status

# Rollback and retry
npm run migrate:rollback
npm run migrate
```

#### Multi-Tenant Issues

**Issue**: Tenant isolation not working
```bash
# Solution: Verify tenant context
./scripts/validate-unified.sh production implementation

# Check database row-level security
psql -h localhost -U sparc -d sparc -c "SELECT current_setting('app.current_tenant_id');"
```

**Issue**: SSP client switching slow
```bash
# Solution: Check Redis cache
redis-cli ping
redis-cli info memory

# Clear cache if needed
redis-cli flushdb
```

#### Hardware Integration Issues

**Issue**: Device discovery not working
```bash
# Solution: Check network connectivity
ping <device-ip>
nmap -p 80,443 <device-ip>

# Verify ONVIF/OSDP protocols
./scripts/test-device-integration.sh
```

**Issue**: Video streaming issues
```bash
# Solution: Check camera streams
ffprobe rtsp://<camera-ip>/stream1

# Test video service
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/video/cameras/<camera-id>/stream
```

#### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow API responses
```bash
# Solution: Check performance metrics
./scripts/validate-unified.sh production performance

# Monitor database queries
npm run db:monitor

# Check Redis cache hit rates
redis-cli info stats
```

**Issue**: High memory usage
```bash
# Solution: Monitor resource usage
docker stats
kubectl top pods -n sparc

# Check for memory leaks
npm run test:memory-leak
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Always start by checking service logs
2. **Run Health Checks**: Use `./scripts/deploy-unified.sh [env] --health-check-only` for system status
3. **Verify Implementation**: Use `./scripts/validate-unified.sh` to check requirements
4. **Check Documentation**: Refer to specific service documentation in `docs/`
5. **Community Support**: Visit our community forum for additional help

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
```bash
# Set debug environment variables
export DEBUG=sparc:*
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Restart services with debug logging
npm run dev:debug
```
