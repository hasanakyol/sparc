## üîÑ In Progress Tasks

None currently in progress.

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Priority 1: Critical Scripts (Week 1)

- Handle all environments (development, staging, production)
- Support deployment modes (standard, blue-green, rollback)
- Include pre-deployment validation
- Post-deployment health checks

- Secret detection
- Generate unified report
- Integration with CI/CD gates

### Priority 2: Service-Level Updates (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Audit Service package.json Files

- [ ] Type checking commands

**Services to check**:
- [ ] api-gateway

- [ ] `update-validation-metrics.sh` - Update metrics dashboard

### Priority 4: Documentation (Week 2-3)

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Completed
- Documentation updates: 4/4 ‚úÖ
- Critical scripts created: 4/4 ‚úÖ
- GitHub workflows updated: 2/2 ‚úÖ

### Remaining
- Unified scripts to create: 2
- Services to audit: 24
- CI/CD scripts to create: 6
- Documentation files to update: ~10

### Overall Progress: 70% Complete

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Create `deploy-unified.sh` script
2. **Follow-up**: Create `security-scan-unified.sh` script
3. **Then**: Audit all service package.json files
4. **Finally**: Complete remaining CI/CD support scripts

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Flat Structure**: All scripts in root scripts/ directory with category prefixes
2. **Unified Scripts**: Three main scripts handle most operations:
   - `deploy-unified.sh` - All deployment operations
   - `validate-unified.sh` - All validation operations
   - `security-scan-unified.sh` - All security operations
3. **Naming Convention**: `action-target.sh` format (e.g., `test-device-integration.sh`)
4. **Script Count**: Reduced from 40+ to 23 essential scripts

### Migration Notes
- Old scripts referenced in docs have been mapped to new equivalents
- Some scripts were consolidated into unified versions
- Legacy script names preserved in comments for reference

### Testing Requirements
- All scripts must be idempotent
- Scripts should support `--help` flag
- Critical scripts need `--dry-run` mode
- All scripts must handle errors gracefully
