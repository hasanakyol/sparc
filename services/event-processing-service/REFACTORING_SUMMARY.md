# Event Processing Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Event Processing service from a monolithic structure to use the MicroserviceBase pattern with Socket.IO integration and proper modularization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Microservice Implementation
- **File**: `src/index.microservice.ts`
- Extends `MicroserviceBase` class
- Integrated Socket.IO server for real-time communication
- Background event correlation processing
- Custom health checks and metrics

### 2. Modularized Routes
Created separate route modules:
- **`routes/events.ts`**: Event submission and querying (access, video, environmental)
- **`routes/alerts.ts`**: Alert management, acknowledgment, and resolution
- **`routes/notifications.ts`**: Notification preferences and delivery management

### 3. Service Layer Architecture
- **`services/event-processing-service.ts`**: Core event processing logic
  - Event correlation engine
  - Real-time event streaming
  - Event buffering and analysis
  
- **`services/alert-service.ts`**: Alert management
  - Alert generation and lifecycle
  - Severity-based notification routing
  - Statistics and reporting
  
- **`services/notification-service.ts`**: Multi-channel notifications
  - Email (SMTP)
  - SMS (Twilio)
  - Web Push notifications

### 4. Key Features Preserved
- Real-time event streaming via Socket.IO
- Event correlation and pattern detection
- Multi-channel alert notifications
- Tenant-based event isolation
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution workflow
- Push notification subscriptions

### 5. Architecture Improvements
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular service design
- Built-in health monitoring
- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Improved error handling

## Migration Steps

1. Review and test the new implementation
2. Update environment variables:
   ```
   REDIS_STREAM_PREFIX=sparc:events
   CORRELATION_INTERVAL=5000
   EVENT_RETENTION_HOURS=24
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=notifications@sparc.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=xxx
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxx
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
   TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=xxx
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
   ```
3. Replace `index.ts` with `index.microservice.ts`
4. Remove legacy code and test files
5. Update client applications to use Socket.IO endpoint

## WebSocket Events

The service emits the following real-time events:
- `access_event`: Access control events
- `video_event`: Video analytics events
- `environmental_event`: Environmental sensor events
- `alert`: New alert generated
- `alert_update`: Alert status changed

## Benefits
- Better code organization with clear service boundaries
- Reusable notification service for multiple channels
- Built-in event correlation engine
- Standardized alert lifecycle management
- Real-time event streaming with Socket.IO
- Consistent with other refactored services
