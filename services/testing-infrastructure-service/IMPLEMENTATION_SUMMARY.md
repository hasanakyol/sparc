## Remaining Tasks

### 3. Additional Services Needed

#### Performance Test Service
```typescript
// Should include:
- Lighthouse integration for web vitals

- Budget validation
- Trend analysis
- Resource usage monitoring
```

#### Test Metrics Service
```typescript
// Should include:

- Executive summaries
- Trend reports
- Comparison reports
- Automated distribution
```

### 4. Route Handlers
Need to create Express/Hono route handlers in `src/routes/`:
- `tests.ts` - Test execution endpoints
- `executions.ts` - Execution management
- `metrics.ts` - Metrics endpoints
- `reports.ts` - Report generation
- `cicd.ts` - CI/CD webhooks

### 5. Test Infrastructure

#### k6 Scripts (`/k6` directory)
- Load test scenarios
- Stress test configurations
- Spike test scripts
- Soak test configurations

#### Playwright Tests (`/playwright` directory)
- Page object models
- Test fixtures
- Custom reporters
- Configuration files

#### CI/CD Integration (`/scripts` directory)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- GitLab CI templates
- Jenkins pipelines
- CircleCI configurations

### 6. Test Data Management
- Test data factories
- Data cleanup utilities
- Fixture management
- Environment configuration

### 7. Test Orchestration
- Test suite scheduling
- Parallel execution management
- Resource allocation
- Queue management

## Usage Examples

### Running E2E Tests
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3012/api/tests/e2e/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "testSuite": "auth-workflows",
    "browser": "chromium",
    "environment": "staging"
  }'
```

### Running Load Tests
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3012/api/tests/load/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scenario": "full-platform",
    "vusers": 1000,
    "duration": 300,
    "rampUp": 60
  }'
```

### Running Security Scan
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3012/api/tests/security/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target": "https://staging.sparc.com",
    "scanType": "full"
  }'
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining services (Performance, Metrics, Reports)
2. Implement route handlers
3. Create test scripts and configurations
4. Add CI/CD integration templates
5. Implement test data management utilities
6. Build test orchestration framework
7. Add monitoring and alerting
8. Create comprehensive documentation

## Architecture Benefits

- **Modular Design**: Each test type is a separate service
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new test types
- **Scalable**: Can run tests in parallel across multiple nodes
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
- **Reliable**: Retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Integrated**: Works with existing CI/CD pipelines
