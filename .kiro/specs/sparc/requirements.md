# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for SPARC, a unified physical access control system and video surveillance platform. The system will provide API-first architecture to secure buildings through integrated access management and real-time video monitoring capabilities. The platform serves as a comprehensive security solution that combines traditional access control with modern surveillance technology in a single, cohesive application.

SPARC addresses the growing need for integrated security solutions that can scale from single buildings to enterprise-wide deployments while maintaining the flexibility to serve multiple tenants through a unified platform.

### System Architecture Vision

The platform follows a unified architecture where all components work together seamlessly:
- **Core Platform**: Centralized management of access control, video surveillance, and environmental monitoring
- **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through REST APIs for integration and extensibility
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete isolation between organizations while sharing infrastructure
- **Offline Resilience**: All components maintain functionality for 72 hours without network connectivity
- **Unified Data Model**: Consistent approach to users, permissions, locations, and events across all modules

### Implementation Phase

All requirements will be implemented in a single comprehensive release to deliver the complete unified access control and video surveillance platform.
