## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Alert

#### Automated Detection Sources
- Monitoring alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)
- SIEM security events
- Application error monitoring
- Health check failures
- Customer reports

#### Initial Assessment (5 minutes)
```bash
# System health check
curl https://api.sparc.com/health
./scripts/incident/quick-health-check.sh

# Recent alerts
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running

# Error analysis
grep ERROR /var/log/sparc/*.log | tail -100
kubectl logs -l tier=critical --tail=100 --since=15m
```

### Phase 2: Triage & Classification

#### Triage Checklist
- [ ] Identify affected services and scope
- [ ] Determine user/customer impact
- [ ] Assess data integrity status
- [ ] Check security implications
- [ ] Review recent changes
- [ ] Assign severity level (SEV-1 through SEV-4)
- [ ] Identify required team members

#### Incident Declaration
```
@here SEV-[1-4] Incident Declared
Time: [timestamp]
Title: [Brief description]
Impact: [User/service impact]
IC: @[incident-commander]
Channel: #incident-[YYYY-MM-DD-###]
War Room: [Zoom link]
```

### Phase 3: Investigation

#### Data Collection
```bash
# Comprehensive log collection

# Force password reset
UPDATE users SET 
  password_reset_required = true,
  sessions_revoked_at = NOW();

# Block suspicious IPs
iptables -A INPUT -s <malicious-ip> -j DROP
```

#### 2. DDoS Attack Mitigation
```bash
# Enable DDoS protection
aws shield associate-drt-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::account:role/DRTRole

# Rate limiting
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 \
  -m limit --limit 100/sec -j ACCEPT

  --zone-id=$ZONE_ID \
  --settings='{"security_level":"under_attack"}'
```

#### 3. Malware/Ransomware Response
```bash
# Immediate isolation
kubectl cordon --all
kubectl delete pods --all -n sparc-prod

# Preserve evidence
tar -czf /forensics/infected-state-$(date +%s).tar.gz \
  /var/log /etc /home

# System restoration from clean backups
./scripts/recovery/restore-from-backup.sh --point-in-time "2 hours ago"
```

#### 4. Account Compromise
```bash
# Disable compromised accounts
UPDATE users 
SET status = 'suspended',
    suspension_reason = 'Security incident - Account compromise'
WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM suspicious_activity);

## Containment Strategies

### Containment Decision Matrix

| Threat Type | Immediate Action | Secondary Action | Rollback Trigger |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Active Attacker | Full network isolation | Deploy honeypot | Threat eliminated |
| Data Exfiltration | Block all egress | Revoke all access | Leak contained |

iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Service isolation
kubectl taint nodes <node> isolated=true:NoSchedule
kubectl patch deployment <name> \
  -p '{"spec":{"replicas":0}}'

# Data isolation
ALTER DATABASE sparc_prod SET default_transaction_read_only = on;
```

# Data validation
psql -d sparc_restored -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM critical_tables;"
./scripts/recovery/validate-data-integrity.sh
```

#### Phase 3: Service Recovery
```bash
# Health verification
for svc in auth api-gateway video-service notification; do
  echo "Checking $svc..."
  curl -f http://$svc:3000/health || echo "FAILED"
done

# Smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Critical path validation
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "critical"
```

#### Phase 4: Security Validation
```bash
# Vulnerability scanning
trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH sparc/*:latest

# Security audit
./scripts/security/post-incident-audit.sh

# Access review

```

#### Phase 5: Progressive Restoration
```bash
# Gradual traffic increase
for i in 5 10 25 50 100; do
  kubectl patch svc api-gateway \
    -p "{\"spec\":{\"selector\":{\"canary\":\"$i\"}}}"
