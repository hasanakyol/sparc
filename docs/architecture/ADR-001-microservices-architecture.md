# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The SPARC Security Platform needs to handle 10,000+ concurrent users and 100,000+ video streams while maintaining high availability, scalability, and maintainability. The system requires independent scaling of different components and must support multiple deployment environments.

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture with the following characteristics:
- Each service owns its domain and data
- Services communicate via REST APIs and gRPC
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Service mesh (Istio) for inter-service communication

## Consequences

### Positive
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity (best tool for each job)
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy
- Easier to understand individual services

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Data consistency challenges
- Debugging across services is harder
- Need for sophisticated monitoring

## Implementation
- 24 microservices identified
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Istio service mesh
- OpenTelemetry for observability
